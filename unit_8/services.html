			<h4>Visa</h4>
			<p>If you go oversee for more than three months you probably need a student VISA. Different countries have very different rules, but the important thing is being aware of what is needed and knowing the process to get it (timing, documents, authorities, etc.). How can you do that? Good news for you: others have done it before you and processes remain similar over time. In this section you will find all information you need to obtain your VISA and we will help you to go through the whole process.</p>

			<h4>Housing</h4>
			<p>Finding a house or a room may sound like an easy one, but there are many hidden obstacles you will encounter or you have already encountered. In many places it may be hard to rent convenient places for less than one year, and what if you want to keep your place for when you are coming back? </p>
